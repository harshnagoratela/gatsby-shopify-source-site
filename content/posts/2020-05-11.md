Small & vital beats large & easily replacable. Many busiensses try to serve ever larger audiences, offer expanding products catalogs, and generally work to grow by adding more. This takes additional management and coordination, which often distracts from what the business does best.

Instead, organizations should work to get better at a smaller number of specialties. Create the very best products for a small segment of the market. Find the audience that can't get by without the services and products offered. Then work to become vital to those businesses. Identify ways to become vertical in order to better manage the entire experience.
