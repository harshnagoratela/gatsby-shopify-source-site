  Asynchronous communication is possible via a number of digital methods,
  including email, recorded video, blogging, etc. The most powerful aspect of
  asynchronous communication is that information can be produced once, then used
  to spark conversations, answer questions, and increase reach well beyond
  what's possible in real time.

Asynchronous communication is a very powerful feature and it's too often overlooked in the digital  economy. Instead, real-time communication is prioritized, likely as both a response to the 'distant' nature of digital and as a way to replicate physical world communication.

Recently huge numbers of people have moved to video conferencing, with Zoom shifting from a niche business-oriented tool to a mass, consumer-used product. It's a great tool and like other real-time communication tools, it requires a lot of coordination among participants to set a time and has limited evergreen opportunities.

Likewise, Slack has seen a big surge in usage with the recent shift to working from home. Unlike Zoom, it doesn't require real-time coordination among participants. Instead, various channels/topics/rooms are generated and participants contribute comments on their own schedule with all updates, replies, and feedback saved for later review.

Of course, asynchronous communication is possible via a number of digital methods, including email, recorded video, blogging, etc. The most powerful aspect of asynchronous communication is that information can be produced once, then used to spark conversations, answer questions, and increase reach well beyond what's possible in real time.
