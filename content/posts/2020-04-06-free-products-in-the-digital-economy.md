The digital economy makes it easy to reproduce products with zero marginal costs. Once a digital good is made, there's almost no cost to making another copy.  

This is an enormous difference from the traditional economy and too often overlooked. The size of the audience in a digital world is immense and it's much more likely that most of any given target audience will never even hear of your product - let alone considering purchasing.

Find a way to offer something of value and remove the price barrier. Expand the potential market, build authority & trust, then offer high-valued paid products.

Providing an initial free sample is a classic marketing strategy because it works - and it's more powerful than ever in the digital economy.
