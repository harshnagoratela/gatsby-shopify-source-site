In the digital economy, there's no room for average. Organizations must become *uncommon* by creating exceptional work that appeals to the core audience.

When everyone has nearly equal access to the same products, services, & information, there's no reason to settle for less than the best.

Gone are the days when it was enough to be a mediocre business in the right place. In the digital economy, trust & reputations are built and read in the public eye.

To stand out, identify a small number of like-minded people who are waiting to be shown something better. Delve into your niche, talk to the people, and find ways to make something that speaks specifically to those people. Uncommon wins in the digital economy, and if you're willing to listen, your audience will inform what they need next.
