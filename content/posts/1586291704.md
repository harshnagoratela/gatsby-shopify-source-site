 The company, which began as a direct-to-consumer brand, first took steps to reduce its burn rate by shuttering its now 10 retail stores, while paying its retail teams “during what we hoped would be short-term closures.” Unsurprisingly, given that human capital is typically a company’s biggest cost center, that strategy didn’t go far enough, so the company is having to furlough “about half” of its team and it’s laying off another 10%, it says.
