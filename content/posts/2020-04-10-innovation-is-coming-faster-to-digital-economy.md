  It's a really difficult time in the world - and it's exciting to think about
  the innovations coming to the digital economy.  More people are shopping
  online than ever before and it will increase the speed of innovation in

It's a really difficult time in the world - and it's exciting to think about the innovations coming to to the digital economy.
