Local commerce is changing quickly. It isn't gone entirely and there are opportunities to strengthen.

The coming months will force many small businesses to close, including many that make up local commerce. Businesses that survive need to continue to serve their local communities, while looking for openings to expand beyond local.

Identify the qualities that make a local business great, then work to extrapolate those very great things to another audience. Perhaps adding shippable versions of local products, honing in on serving suddenly dis-jointed communities, etc.

Local commerce will need to rely more heavily on technology. It won't be an easy transition and once done - it opens many new opportunities for local commerce to expand into digital commerce.
