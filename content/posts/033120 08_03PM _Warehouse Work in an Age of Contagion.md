> I have many friends in the service industry—waiters, bartenders, booksellers—who are hurting financially right now. I, on the other hand, am actually benefitting financially from the pandemic. Prior to its arrival on our shores, I was working 18.5 hours a week and earning $16 an hour. But since the pandemic came to America, our hourly wages have increased by two dollars and the company is offering almost unlimited extra hours of work to those who want them. This week I picked up two extra 4.5-hour shifts (I would have picked up more but no one is permitted to work more than six days in a row). Prior to the pandemic, I grossed $296 per week. This week I grossed $495. I expect to keep earning that higher figure through at least the end of April and possibly well beyond that. Overtime pay has also been increased during the emergency. Instead of being paid the usual time-and-a-half, those who work more than eight hours in a day or 40 hours in a week are paid double time. Money alone wouldn’t inspire me to put my health at risk by going to work during a pandemic. But it does sweeten the pot a bit.
